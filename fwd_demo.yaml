        description: The column appears to be a business news article discussing the impact of President Donald Trump's tariff policies on the stock market, specifically the shares of tech companies such as Apple, Amazon, and Nvidia, and how a false report of a potential 90-day tariff pause caused a brief surge and subsequent drop in the market.

            is a deputy editor with 18 years of experience writing and editing product reviews, gadgets and business news. Previously, he was a deputy editor covering technology companies at CNBC.

            Shares of Apple, Amazon, and other tech stocks are getting walloped on Thursday as the markets digest the impact of President Donald Trump’s new round of tariffs announced on Wednesday evening.

            Shares of Apple were down about 9 percent on Thursday morning, which would mark the biggest drop in about five years if it holds until the close, according to CNBC. Amazon shares dropped about 7 percent.

            Both companies rely heavily on imports from other countries, like China, on which Trump plans to impose a 54 percent tariff beginning April 9th. Apple also manufactures some products in countries like Vietnam, on which a 46 percent tariff was announced.

            The tariffs, if they aren’t walked back, could mean increased prices on electronics for consumers or slimmer margins for companies like Apple and Amazon if they choose to eat some of the costs. Apple has typically had a gross margin, the amount of cash it gets to keep after it sells stuff, of around 38 percent, though it has been higher. Wall Street is likely concerned about lower demand if Apple has to increase the price of Macs, iPhones, iPads, and other products.

            Other big tech companies were impacted as well. Shares of Nvidia were down more than 4 percent on Thursday morning while Tesla stock was also down about 4 percent, giving up most of its Wednesday gains. Shares of Meta are down about 7 percent.

            The stock market went on a rollercoaster ride this morning, shooting upwards after news circulated online that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day pause of his global tariff policy. However, the White House has now called the information “fake news.” After it became apparent that Trump has no intention of backing down from a policy most economists have dubbed totally insane, the market acted accordingly and dropped like a stone.

            It’s unclear exactly where the news originated, although online chatter and multiple news outlets have pointed to it having been boosted by one particular X account. Business Insider writes that the tweet came from an account known as “Walter Bloomberg” which typically posts headlines and information from news outlets. According to BI, that tweet read: “HASSETT: TRUMP IS CONSIDERING A 90-DAY PAUSE IN TARIFFS FOR ALL COUNTRIES EXCEPT CHINA,” in an apparent reference to Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, who recently went on Fox News to discuss Trump’s tariff policy. The tweet has since been deleted. Gizmodo reached out to the account via email for comment.

            However, around the same time, the news was also briefly perpetuated by multiple reputable outlets, including Reuters. An archived version of the Reuters report claims that “White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said in an interview that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries expect China.” Indeed, the Walter Bloomberg account has claimed that he first heard the news from Reuters.

            When reached for comment by Gizmodo, Reuters said that it had initially heard the news from a television report from CNBC. A spokesperson said, in a statement: “Reuters, drawing from a headline on CNBC, published a story on April 7 saying White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett had said that President Donald Trump was considering a 90-day tariff pause on all countries except China. The White House denied the report. Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error.”

            With the apparent news that Trump might roll back his daft economic policy, the market rose precipitously—shooting up 8.5 percent in 34 minutes, BI writes.

            However, the White House was quick to shoot down the media reports. Rapid Response 47, which is the Trump administration’s social media account on X, quote-tweeted the news, writing: “Wrong. Fake News.” The market promptly plummeted.

            Later Monday morning, a Bloomberg business reporter came out to disavow any link between the news outlet and the “Walter Bloomberg” social media account: “PSA: Do not rely on Walter Bloomberg X account. He doesn’t work for us and is not authorized by Bloomberg.”

            Barron’s writes that the tweet may have been a misunderstanding of Hassett’s Monday morning interview with Fox. During that interview, Hassett was asked whether Trump would consider pausing his tariffs and Hassett responded that “the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide,” whatever that’s supposed to mean.

            “INSANE market action right now,” wrote Joe Weisenthal, who runs Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast. “Market exploded higher on a headline attributed to Kevin Hassett. And now nobody can figure out where it came from and the markets are diving again. An 8% surge and then a 3.5% plunge in a matter of seconds.”

            Other web-users chimed in to comment on the ridiculousness of the situation. “s&p is now a memecoin,” one X user wrote.

            “You know The Economy is real when trillions of dollars can move up and down based on a tweet of a made-up quote,” said another user.

            Another user noted that the account being blamed for the mistake is “verified” by X’s standards, meaning the person operating the account pays a monthly subscription fee in exchange for “verification.” Twitter verification used to be reserved largely for professional media organizations and was determined by an internal team. Since Elon Musk took over the platform, anybody can be an expert, as long as they pay Musk’s company money. “Twitter letting random users pay $8 a month for a verified badge just led to a $4 trillion market mistake caused by fake news,” someone wrote.

            Trump’s tariff policies have sent the global economy into a tailspin, with critics maintaining that the world is headed for recession. The president has sought to alleviate concerns about evaporating 401ks by coining a new, deeply idiotic term: Panican, as in an American who panics. “The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,” Trump said, in a post to his website, Truth Social, on Monday. “Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!”
